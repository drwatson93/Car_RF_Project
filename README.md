# Car Research and findings Project

In this project, I created a data scraping spider using a python library called scrappy. The task of the spider was to scrape all data for "Ford Mustangs" currently on sale on Auto.com. the spider was instructed to return key values like descriptions, value, milage, and body type. The data was then exported to a excel document for further use.
## Requirements

Works on Linux, Windows, macOS, BSD
